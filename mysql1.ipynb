    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and accessed in a systematic way. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently. Databases are widely used in various applications, ranging from simple to complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases: These databases use structured query language (SQL) to interact with the data. They are based on a relational model and use tables to store data. SQL databases ensure data integrity, support complex queries, and provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases: These databases use a variety of data models for storing and retrieving data. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases are not based on a rigid schema. They are highly scalable and flexible, allowing for horizontal scaling and handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases include document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), columnar databases (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
